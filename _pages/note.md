# Notes

I plan to upload my notes on basic math courses and some novel topics about microeconomics. I list some topics that may take years to update.

## Math Notes

Notes on Topology (based on *Topology* by Munkres)

Notes on Duality Theory

Notes on Convex Analysis (based on *Convex Analysis* by Rockafellar)

## Economics Notes

How to Compare Information Structures?

Three Proofs of Best-Response-Undominance Equivalence
