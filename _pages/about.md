Hello! I am a first-year PhD student in Economics at the Pennsylvania State University. Prior to the PhD career, I obtained a Master degree in Economics at Duke University and a Bachelor degree in Political Science in Peking University, China.

My major academic interests include game theory, information economics and political economics. Specifically, my research agenda locates on the nexus among (i) principal-agent models, (ii) information design, and (iii) application in political economics. In addition, I have some long-standing interest in auctions, cheap talks, accountability in non-democracies, etc.
