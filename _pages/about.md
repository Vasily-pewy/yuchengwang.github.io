Hello! I am a second-year PhD student in Economics at the Pennsylvania State University. Prior to the PhD career, I obtained a Master degree in Economics at Duke University and a Bachelor degree in Political Science in Peking University, China.

My major academic interests include game theory, information economics and political economics. Specifically, my research agenda locates on the nexus among (i) communication models, (ii) information design, and (iii) application in political economics for democracy and non-democracies. In addition, I have long-standing interest in advanced mathematic tools, such as convex analysis and infinite-dimensional optimization.
